# Proof Assets Pack

This folder captures the proof assets referenced on the Campus Help “Phase 0” page.

Each asset follows the requested format:

1. **Portfolio site refresh** – A Next.js 15 relaunch living at the confirmed Vercel primary domain.
2. **Deploy + debug win** – CI/CD stabilization proof from the GitHub Actions history for this repo.
3. **Resume tune-up before/after** – Word-ready document with before/after bullet structure.

The optional testimonial file reinforces the same story and can be shared alongside the assets.
